```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I copied the files that I received by email to a subdirectory, "data". The two files received by email are "chr15_hotspots.tsv" and "DO_summedKO_rankz_20180410.rds".

In examining the .tsv file, we see that it contains one row of information (plus a header row).

The one row specifies two phenotypes that both map to chromosome 15. The two phenotypes are: "K01657" and "K02502".
